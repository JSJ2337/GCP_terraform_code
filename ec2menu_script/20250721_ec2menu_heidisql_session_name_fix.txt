Summary:
The user requested a modification to the `ec2menu_v4.37.py` script. When connecting to an RDS instance, the session name in HeidiSQL was appearing as "LOCALHOST". The user wanted the session name to reflect the actual RDS instance ID for better identification.

Resolution Steps:
1.  **Initial Request:** User asked to change the HeidiSQL session name from "LOCALHOST" to the RDS instance name in `ec2menu_v4.37.py`.
2.  **Attempt 1 (v4.38):** I created `ec2menu_v4.38.py`, modifying the HeidiSQL command to include the `-session={db['Id']}` parameter.
3.  **User Feedback:** The user reported that the change was ineffective and the session name was still "LOCALHOST".
4.  **Correction (v4.39):** After researching HeidiSQL command-line arguments, I discovered that `--description` is the correct parameter to name a new session, not `-session`. I then created `ec2menu_v4.39.py`, replacing `-session` with `--description={db['Id']}`.
5.  **Confirmation:** The user confirmed that the solution in `ec2menu_v4.39.py` worked as expected.

Final working script version: `ec2menu_v4.39.py`
